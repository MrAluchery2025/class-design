# class-design
This project is about creating a custom Python class called Superhero. It shows how Object-Oriented Programming works using attributes, constructors, and methods. I also added two subclasses (FlyingHero and TechHero) to demonstrate inheritance and polymorphism.

The Superhero class has basic features like introducing the hero and using their power. The subclasses override the use_power() method to make it unique for each hero type. Encapsulation is shown using private and protected attributes.
